#summary Short essay on dealing with page-breaks.

= Those Pesky Page-Breaks =

Printed books have pages, and thus page-breaks every couple of hundred words or so. Electronic files do not have this concept, but since pages and page numbers have traditionally been used to refer to passages in books, they can be captured in `<pb>` elements, which, for good reason, can appear almost anywhere in a TEI document. Here is where the trouble starts.

== Encoding ==

When a page-break occurs between two divisions, it can be encoded in various was, e.g., before the closing tag:

{{{
<pb n="123"/>
</div1>
<div1>
}}}

Between the closing and opening tag:

{{{
</div1>
<pb n="123"/>
<div1>
}}}

After the opening tag:

{{{
</div1>
<div1>
<pb n="123"/>
}}}
