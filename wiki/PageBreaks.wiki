#summary Short essay on dealing with page-breaks.

= Those Pesky Page-Breaks =

Printed books have pages, and thus page-breaks every couple of hundred words or so. Electronic files do not have this concept, but since pages and page numbers have traditionally been used to refer to passages in books, they can be captured in `<pb>` elements, which, for good reason, can appear almost anywhere in a TEI document. Here is where the trouble starts.

== Encoding ==

When a page-break occurs between two divisions, it can be encoded in various was, e.g., before the closing tag:

{{{
<pb n="123"/>
</div1>
<div1>
}}}

Between the closing and opening tag:

{{{
</div1>
<pb n="123"/>
<div1>
}}}

After the opening tag:

{{{
</div1>
<div1>
<pb n="123"/>
}}}

Various guidelines for TEI propose different (conflicting) conventions for each option. The `tei2html` scripts all assume the first option (before the closing tag) This way, the generated tables of content, etc., refer to page-number that is current when the `<div1>` tag occurs.

== Cross-References ==

As mentioned, cross-references in printed book often reference to page numbers. The easiest way to encode this is to do something like this:

{{{
<ref target="pb123">Some referring text</ref>.
}}}

That links to some `<pb id="pb123" n="123"/>` somewhere in text. Now, of course, the reference is never to the page-break itself, but always to some content that appears on that page, but actually identifying and linking to the content referred to can be a time-consuming task, so is often postponed (think, for example, about an index).
