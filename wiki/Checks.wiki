#summary Tools to check TEI documents for various issues.

= Introduction =

Proposed tools to check various TEI conventions and textual issues.


= Numbering =

Verify whether numbered items are in sequence.

  * page-breaks `<pb>`
  * divisions `<div#>`

= Quotation Marks =

Verify whether quotation marks are applied correctly.

Quotation marks need to be nested correctly, and for each
opening mark, there should be a corresponding closing mark.

This is slightly complicated by several facts:

  * different types of usage
    * US: outer double, inner single quotation marks
    * UK: outer single, inner double quotation marks
  * different conventions for languages and countries.
  * usage around other punctuation might vary.
  * non-closed marks are to be re-opened in next paragraph.
