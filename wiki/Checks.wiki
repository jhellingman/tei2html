#summary Tools to check TEI documents for various issues.

= Introduction =

XSLT style-sheet to check various TEI conventions and textual issues.


= Metadata =

Verify metadata is present and correct.

= Rendering =

Verify valid rendering attributes are used

  * valid CSS-based rendition ladders
  * valid tei2html extensions.

= Types =

Verify types for elements are valid according to the conventions.

= Numbering =

Verify whether numbered items are in sequence.

  * page-breaks `<pb>`
  * divisions `<div#>`

= Spacing and Punctuation =

Verify punctuation marks are properly spaced.

= Quotation Marks =

Verify whether quotation marks are applied correctly.

Quotation marks need to be nested correctly, and for each
opening mark, there should be a corresponding closing mark.

This is slightly complicated by several facts:

  * different types of usage
    * US: outer double, inner single quotation marks
    * UK: outer single, inner double quotation marks
  * different conventions for languages and countries.
  * usage around other punctuation might vary.
  * non-closed marks are to be re-opened in next paragraph.
