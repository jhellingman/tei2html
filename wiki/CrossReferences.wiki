#summary How to encode cross-references.

= Internal Cross References =

Internal cross-references are to be encoded using the `<ref>` element, with the `@target` attribute carrying the id of the target element referenced to.

== Special types of references ==

*Footnotes:* Sometimes footnotes markers appear multiple times on a page, each referring to the same note. When these are encoded as follows:

`<ref target="n123.1" type="noteref">1</note>`

They will be rendered as a superscript number with the actual number replacing the content.

*Page numbers:* When a reference is made to a pagenumber, you can encode these as follows:

`See page <ref target="pb123" type="pageref">123</note> for details.`

When this is rendered on page media, the content will be replaced with the actual page number of the page the reference appears on.

= External Cross References =

External cross-references are to be encoded using the `<xref>` element, with the `@url` attribute carrying the url of the resource referenced.

== Shorthand notations ==

*Project Gutenberg text:* Use `pg:<`_ebook number_`>` as url.
