#summary Code to merge multiple TEI files into a single TEI file.

= Introduction =

Larger works where often issued in multi-volume sets, and as a result also encoded as separate TEI files. However, in files do not have the restrictions of physical bound volumes, and it is often beneficial to merge two TEI files into a single TEI file. This will help in particular when there are a lot of internal cross-references between the volumes, such as will happen with an index.


= Steps =

== 1. Create an XSLT 'galley' file ==

The idea is to create an XSLT stylesheet that will merge the individual volumes, and provide them with a new TEI-header (which in turn can also be put together from elements pulled from one or more of the source TEI files.

== 2. Run the XSLT galley file ==

This will collect the content, and put it together into a single TEI file.

== 3. Use the combined file as source ==

= Galley File Support Functions =

Most of the hard work happens in the creation of the galley file. For this a number of support functions will be needed.
