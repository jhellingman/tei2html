= Scratch Pad =

== Small improvements ==

  * Use page-break-after in CSS for ePub versions. See http://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/p/page-break/ and http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_print_pageba.asp

== Interesting Links ==

  * [http://code.google.com/p/hyphenator/] Javascript hyphenator.


== Metadata ==

Adding metadata about the series a book belongs to in ePub is not yet standardized. Follow the calibre convention for now:

{{{
<meta name="calibre:series" content="CAC"/>
<meta name="calibre:series_index" content="29"/>
}}}

For ePub 3.0, see http://www.idpf.org/epub/301/spec/epub-publications.html#sec-opf-dctitle
