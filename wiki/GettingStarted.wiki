#summary How to get started with `tei2html`

= Prerequisites and Installation =

See the page on [Installation installation].

Note that currently no installer is present, so you will need to get the code from the repository directly.

= Running from the command line =

Most of the interaction on the command line is with small Perl scripts that start the actual XSLT processor, and some other scripts.

Before you can run the Perl scripts, you will need to make sure the paths to the various executables are configured correctly.

To do this, go to `tools/tei2html.pl` and look for a section of code called configuration, and change the paths indicated here to what is current on your machine:

{{{
#==============================================================================
# Configuration

my $toolsdir        = "C:\\Users\\Jeroen\\Documents\\eLibrary\\Tools\\tei2html\\tools";   # location of tools
my $patcdir         = $toolsdir . "\\patc\\transcriptions"; # location of patc transcription files.
my $xsldir          = "C:\\Users\\Jeroen\\Documents\\eLibrary\\Tools\\tei2html";  # location of xsl stylesheets
my $tmpdir          = "C:\\Temp";                       # place to drop temporary files
my $bindir          = "C:\\Bin";
my $catalog         = "C:\\Bin\\pubtext\\CATALOG";      # location of SGML catalog (required for nsgmls and sx)

my $prince          = "\"C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Prince\\Engine\\bin\\prince.exe\"";
my $saxon2          = "\"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre6\\bin\\java.exe\" -jar C:\\bin\\saxonhe9\\saxon9he.jar "; # (see http://saxon.sourceforge.net/)

my $epubcheck       = "\"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre6\\bin\\java.exe\" -jar C:\\bin\\epubcheck\\epubcheck-1.0.4.jar ";
my $epubpreflight   = "\"C:\\Program Files\\Java\\jre6\\bin\\java.exe\" -jar C:\\bin\\epubcheck\\epubpreflight-0.1.0.jar ";

}}}

Note to self: This needs considerable cleanup, and use of environment variables where possible.


= Running interactively =

No easy window-based interface is yet available. I am working on a small HTML application to run the scripts interactively.
