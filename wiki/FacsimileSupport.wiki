#summary What needs to be done to support the TEI P5 facsimile features.

= Introduction =

TEI P5 contains a [http://www.tei-c.org/release/doc/tei-p5-doc/en/html/ref-facsimile.html facsimile element] to represent scanned documents, as well as some other features to better support facsimiles. These features can be used to link to the original scans.

Often scans are already available at some place on the web, and we may wish to point to them, sometimes, we wish to include them with or production, so we have two types of facsimiles: external images and internal images.

= Facsimile Element =

The `facsimile` element is a top-level element, that describes a series of page images, and can stand independently of the transcribed text. This allows to specify just the metadata (in the Header) and the scans, to produce a digital facsimile.

{{{
   <facsimile>
      <graphic id=facs123 url="p123.gif"/>
   </facsimile>
}}}

= `@facs` Attribute =

The `@facs` attribute on `pb` elements can be used to point to scanned images of transcribed pages. This can be used to either link to some external source of page images (for example in the Internet Archive), or to link to an internal set of images (kept in a page-images sub-directory, for example).

{{{
  <pb n=123 facs="p123.gif"/>
}}}

Alternatively, it can link to an element in the `facsimile` element, for example:

{{{
  <pb n=123 facs="#facs123"/>
}}}

This later case also allows to point to zones within a page, but that is currently out-of-scope for tei2html.

= Generated Output =

== HTML ==

The output consists of a series of HTML pages, one per page, with some metadata in the heading of the page, and some navigational aids to conveniently jump to another page.

By convention, images will go into a directory `images/pages/`

{{{
  <html>
    <head>
      <title>Document title, page x</title>
    </head>
    <body>
      <div class="facsimile-header">
      </div>
      <div class="facsimile-navigation">
      </div>
      <div class="facsimile-page>
         <img src="\images\pages\p123.gif"/>
      </div>
    </body>
  </html>
}}}


== ePub ==

Similar to HTML, taking into account additions to Spine, metadata, etc.
