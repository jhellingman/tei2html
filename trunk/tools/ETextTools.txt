	Extract TEI tagged notes from a text file.

	usage:

		-h	perpare for HTML output.

	This produces two ouput files:
		
		<filename>.out	The original text without the notes
		<filename>.not	The notes
	
	If the -h option is used, hyperlinks between the two files are inserted.
	otherwise, the notes are indicated with a sequence number in square
	brackets.

tei2txt.pl

	usage:

		perl tei2txt.pl <filename>

	2. Accented and special letters are converted to their nearest ASCII equivalents.


tei2txt.bat

	Convert a TEI file to plain vanilla ASCII.
