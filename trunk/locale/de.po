"            <p class='smallprint'>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>"

"            <p class='smallprint'>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <a href='http://pglaf.org/'>http://pglaf.org</a>.</p>"

"            <p class='smallprint'>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>"

"            <p class='smallprint'>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>"

Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

""
"            <p class='smallprint'>Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>"
""
"            <p class='smallprint'>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>"
""
"            <p class='smallprint'>Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII, compressed (zipped), HTML and others.</p>"
""
"            <p class='smallprint'>Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed. VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving new filenames and etext numbers.</p>"

"            <p class='smallprint'>EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000, are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular search system you may utilize the following addresses and just download by the etext year.</p>"

The year of a release date is no longer part of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:</p>"
