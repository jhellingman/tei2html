== Coding Conventions

=== XSLT Domain

In the XSLT domain, the main naming convention uses dashes, so we use dashes for names of templates, modes, etc., except where such names directly reflect elements from the TEI domain that use _camelCase_.

=== TEI Domain

In the TEI domain, the main naming convention is _camelCase_, so for names primarily used in a TEI context, we follow that.

==== Use of the `@type` attribute

The `@type` attribute can indicate a subclass or special use of a certain element.

==== Special values

The following table gives special values for the `@type` attribute in various contexts. These are
handled in a special way when processing the TEI file.

*TODO* use lower camel case convention for these names.
