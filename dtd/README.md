The DTD's for TEILite and one adjusted for some additional constructs `tei2html` uses. I intend to keep the non-standard 
modifications to TEILite as limited as possible, but I feel free to borrow as much as I like from the full TEI specification as
serves the needs of the books I work on for Project Gutenberg.

Yes, I know I should be using all the nice facilites of TEI to customize, but I was lazy...
